    How I transitioned from Mechanical Engineering into intermediate Web Developer   

</h2 >
<p class = "main_blog" >
    Unarguably Mechanical Engineering is one of the best fields of engineering to pursue. But the taste and passion can be different for people. But every decision you take in your life may not be right. Sometimes you may end up taking courses that may not bring the best in you.
So if you are like me who finished mechanical engineering or any other degree or a field unrelated to Computer Science then this article is for you.
<br>
So how did I make that shift? There is no magic pill, you need to be ready to commit at least 4hrs per day learning and doing projects.  So let’s see how this journey started.

</p>
<h2 class=" main_blog"> How to begin…</h2>
<p class = "main_blog">The first course I took was Neogcamp by Tanay Pratap that is available on youtube and its completely free . It is very comprehensive and easy to understand. This course helped me a lot on taking that 20% to give you 80% of the results, including the latest framework used and best practices. After this course, you will be well good to go with a full-stack project. Which is very impressive, to begin with, you can show this in your portfolio and resume.
    After this, I mainly focused on applying what I learned. You should get your hands dirty by doing as many as projects you can think of. You learn more when you do projects because that’s where you apply your skills.</p>
    <h2 class=" main_blog">Master JavaScript</h2>   
    <p class="main_blog"> No matter what frameworks may come and go. This language is going to stay for long. It’s now the most popular language on the internet. Mastering this should be your priority, then any frameworks will be a cakewalk for you. Moreover, it’s an easy language to understand. No compiler is needed since JavaScript doesn’t require compilation process. The browser interprets JavaScript as it HTML tags.</p>
<h2 class="main_blog">Tutorial Hell…</h2>
<p class = "main_blog">  Be aware of this, you could end up signing in plenty of courses and you end up not doing much and confused. In my honest opinion sign up for the courses that would make a difference that makes you learn a new skill well. The important thing is to practice more by solving problems, creating new projects and also submitting to open source projects.
    When you meet a problem by yourself and find the solution, then the idea is stamped on your brain. Because creating something from scratch requires you to know about the technology well and be able to place everything together. While sticking with tutorials will only give you comfort, once you know something start digging deep by applying it however you can.
    You can join leetcode, hackerearth to practice plenty of problems, These platforms have coding challenges running periodically which can even make you hired with good package.</p>
