 The more we learn the less we know 
</h2>
<p class="main_blog">
    I'm reading the latest book by the great astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson titled Cosmic Queries.
<br>
Chapter One starts way back when most of mankind thought the world was the center of everything and some even thought it was flat.

The chapter progresses through discovery after discovery about the cosmos above us. We go from the once heralded misconceptions of Ptolemy to modern day mysteries about what we currently know.

The fact is: The more we learn about the solar system, the Milky Way galaxy, and the Universe, the more we discover there is to know.

This made me to learning to code .
<br>
Learning to Code is Similar
We start off with "Hello World".

Maybe we should start off with "Hello Flat World"? ðŸ˜‚
<br>
Wow, we know how to code! Feel the power!

Of course, this quickly wears off and our thirst for knowledge continues.

We know there is more out there.

And the fact is, we realize the more we learn, the more there is to know.

The sheer number of tech acronyms can be overwhelming at times without even considering all of the possible libraries, framework choices, design patterns, learning pathways, and so much more.

The Duality of Teaching
Neil DeGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist, but he is also an educator. A teacher.



Teaching helps educators learn as well as students. Researching and discussing topics of interest furthers the knowledge of both teachers and students.

The more I learn, the more I want to know. And that's what drives me.
<br>
It's why I do what I do.
<br>
I hope it drives you, too.
